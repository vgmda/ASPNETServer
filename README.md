## ASPNETServer
> This repository consists of an small CRUD application that demonstrates the use of front-end JavaScript library React and the ASP.NET Core 6 Minimal Web APIs. I used this app to learn and explore how ASP.NET server and client communicate with each other. This app also includes setting up a database on the server with the relevant data for the APIs.
